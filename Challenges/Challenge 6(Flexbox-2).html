            <h1 id="h1">INTERSTELLAR</h1>
            Christopher Nolan’s "Interstellar," about astronauts traveling to the other end of the galaxy to find a new home to replace humanity’s despoiled home-world, is frantically busy and earsplittingly loud. It uses booming music to jack up the excitement level of scenes that might not otherwise excite. It features characters shoveling exposition at each other for almost three hours, and a few of those characters have no character to speak of: they’re mouthpieces for techno-babble and philosophical debate. And for all of the director’s activism on behalf of shooting on film, the tactile beauty of the movie’s 35mm and 65mm textures isn't matched by a sense of composition. The camera rarely tells the story in Nolan's movies. More often it illustrates the screenplay, and there are points in this one where I felt as if I was watching the most expensive NBC pilot ever made.

        <H1 id="h5">INCEPTION</H1>    
        Inception is a sci-fi thriller about a team of experts who use a device called the PASIV to enter people's dreams and manipulate them. The team is led by Dom Cobb, a skilled extractor who is haunted by the memory of his deceased wife, Mal. Cobb is offered a chance to return to his children in the US, who he has not seen for years, if he can perform a rare and risky task: inception. Inception is planting an idea in someone's mind, rather than stealing it. Cobb's target is Robert Fischer, the heir of a powerful business empire. Cobb and his team must create a complex dream within a dream within a dream, and plant the idea that Fischer should dissolve his father's company. Along the way, they face many obstacles, such as Fischer's trained subconscious defenses, Mal's unpredictable appearances, and the danger of losing themselves in the dream world. The movie ends with a cliffhanger, as Cobb spins a top that was Mal's totem, a device that helps him distinguish reality from dreams, and walks away to embrace his children, without checking if the top falls or keeps spinning.
